            <section id="Work">
                <h2>My Work</h2>
                <p>Finally, I want to speak about my work history briefly.</p>
                <p>Over the past 3 years I've worked mostly in marketing for a couple of different companies, doing <strong>content marketing</strong>, particularly blog writing and social media content creation.</p>
                <p>Before that, I started my own business called <a href="https://website.beacons.ai/letstalkspanish1" target="_blank">ESpeak Spanish</a>, where I taught adults to become confident Spanish speakers through one-on-one conversational Spanish lessons.</p>
                <p>As part of this, I created lots of online content. This included lots of video content, a lot of which is on YouTube. Here's an example:</p>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9lhx6g1IPYE?si=tCjr9IVSzew2-B1G" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>And here's another video of me:</p>
                <figure class="vid">
                    <video controls loop src="espeak-video.mp4">Video Unavailable</video>
                    <figcaption>Me speaking in Spanish (loop)</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>But I also created a podcast, Let's Talk Spanish, which has <em>180,000 downloads</em> and reached the <strong>top 5 in the UK for learning Spanish.</strong></p>
                <p>Here's the most recent episode:</p>
                <iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="175" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/mi-amigo-perdi%C3%B3-el-vuelo-my-friend-missed-the-flight/id1482588696?i=1000666115274"></iframe>
                <p>And here's another:</p>

                        <source src="mas-comida-por-favor.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
